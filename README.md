# easyFPGA
easyFPGA is a toolkit that simplifies the design of FPGA-based systems. For further information regarding its features and for obtaining the hardware, please take a look at [easyfpga.de](http://www.easyfpga.de).

## Wiki
A detailed documentation on the usage of the SDK can be found in the [SDK wiki](https://github.com/os-cillation/easyfpga-sdk-java/blob/master/wiki/README.md).

## Cloning
This is the main repository containing everything that is required to use the easyFPGA Java-SDK. The SDK and the HDL sources that are required to build it are included using git submodules. In order to clone everything at once use the recursive switch:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/os-cillation/easyfpga.git
```
