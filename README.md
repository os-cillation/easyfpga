# easyFPGA

This is the main repository containing everything that is required to use the easyFPGA Java-SDK. The SDK and the HDL sources that are required to build it are included using git submodules. In order to clone everything at once use the recursive switch:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/os-cillation/easyfpga.git
```
